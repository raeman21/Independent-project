      <p>
        I am an idividual with varied hobbies and interest. An understanding fellow who gets most of what the world offers and constantly thinks of ways to make it a better place. I take part in various sports including swimming, rugby and football. I adore music
        and dabble in it as often as I can with my favourite being jazz. Because of this I took an interest in learning the guitar and saxophone. I enjoy art and would love to open my own gallery one day. My educational background is a 12 year study period
        in St.Mary's School Nairobi followed by a brief study period in pre-medical school. While there learnt classical Russian as a language to fluency. I have worked as a Data collector for various organizations including Aphia Plus Kenya and Slum/Shack
        Dwellers International. I decided to take up programming because I enjoy solving problems on a day to day basis and programming (coding) gives me that opportunity.
